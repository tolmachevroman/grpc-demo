# Open Standard Client-Server Communication Solutions Comparison

##  Viable Solutions

## 1. [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)

### CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) open standard with excellent maintenance

### Library Status
- **Android**: [grpc-kotlin](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin) - Releases every 6 weeks
- **iOS**: [grpc-swift-2](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift-2) - Monthly releases
- **Server**: All major languages actively maintained

### Pros
- True open standard (CNCF)
- Best-in-class maintenance
- AOSP compatible
- Strong type safety
- Native RPC with pub/sub via streaming
- Industry standard

### Cons
- Steeper learning curve
- Not native WebSocket
- Requires proxy for browsers

---

## 2. [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

### Free, open source, but proprietary protocol

### The Interesting Case
- **Cost**: FREE forever (MIT license)
- **Code**: Completely open source
- **Protocol**: Proprietary (not a standard)
- **Lock-in**: Must use Socket.IO on both client and server

### Library Status
- **Android**: [socket.io-client-java](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-java) - Regular updates
- **iOS**: [socket.io-client-swift](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift) - Maintained, not regularly updated
- **Server**: Very active development (Node.js, Python, Go, Java)

### Pros
- Built-in reconnection and fallbacks
- Room/namespace support
- AOSP compatible
- Huge community

### Cons
- Not an open standard
- Locked into Socket.IO ecosystem
- Can't use standard WebSocket clients
- No code generation
- **FedRAMP concern**: Proprietary protocol may complicate government authorization

---
## 3. Raw WebSockets
#### W3C standard with maximum control

### Library Status
- **Android**: [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) - 46k stars, weekly updates
- **iOS**: Native URLSessionWebSocketTask or [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream)
- **Server**: Universal support in all languages

### Pros
- Ultimate open standard (W3C)
- Complete control
- Libraries will never die
- No dependencies
- AOSP compatible

### Cons
- Must implement everything yourself
- No built-in reconnection
- No fallbacks
- Most development work

---

## 4. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) Subscriptions
### Only if already using GraphQL..

### Library Status
- **Android**: [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) - Active
- **iOS**: [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) - Active

### Pros
- Type-safe subscriptions
- Integrates with existing GraphQL

### Cons
- Requires GraphQL backend
- Not worth adopting just for real-time
- Only viable if GraphQL already in use

---

##  Non-viable Solutions

### Dead on Mobile (Obsolete Libraries)
- **MQTT**: Eclipse Paho Android dead since 2017 (HiveMQ client barely maintained)
- **SSE**: iOS libraries from 2018, effectively abandoned
- **STOMP**: Last Android update 2019
- **AMQP**: No viable mobile libraries
- **XMPP**: Mobile ecosystem abandoned

### Proprietary/Paid Services
- **SignalR**: Microsoft-specific, poor mobile support
- **Firebase**: Won't work on AOSP (needs Play Services), requires FedRAMP authorization
- **PubNub/Pusher/Ably**: Commercial services, must check FedRAMP Marketplace if needed for government

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Solution       | Open Standard | Library Quality | AOSP | FedRAMP   | RPC    | Pub/Sub |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| **Socket.IO**  | No            | Good            | Yes  | Poor      | Yes    | Yes     |
| **gRPC**       | Yes           | Excellent       | Yes  | Excellent | Yes    | Yes     |
| **WebSockets** | Yes           | Excellent       | Yes  | Excellent | Manual | Manual  |
| GraphQL        | Partial       | Good            | Yes  | Good      | Yes    | Yes     |
| MQTT           | Yes           | Dead            | Yes  | Good      | No     | Yes     |
| SSE+REST       | Yes           | Dead iOS        | Yes  | Good      | REST   | SSE     |

\*If GraphQL already exists

**FedRAMP Column Key:**
- **Poor**: Proprietary protocol will complicate government authorization
- **Good**: Open standard, acceptable for FedRAMP
- **Excellent**: Open standard with proven government adoption

## FedRAMP Compliance Considerations

### What FedRAMP Means for Protocol Choice
FedRAMP compliance is about HOW you deploy, not WHAT protocol you use. However, protocol choice impacts your path to compliance:

### Best for FedRAMP: Open Standards
- **gRPC** ✓ CNCF standard, widely accepted in government
- **WebSockets** ✓ W3C standard, maximum transparency
- **GraphQL** ✓ Open specification, acceptable

### Potential Concerns
- **Socket.IO** ⚠️ Proprietary protocol may raise questions during authorization
  - Even though it's free and open source
  - Government prefers open standards
  - May require additional justification

### Self-Hosted vs Managed
- **Self-hosted** (all protocols): You control the compliance
- **Managed services** (Firebase, PubNub, etc.): Provider must be FedRAMP authorized
  - Check the FedRAMP Marketplace first
  - Adds complexity and cost

### Bottom Line for FedRAMP
If government contracts are in your future, **avoid proprietary protocols** even if they're free. Stick with **gRPC or WebSockets** for the smoothest authorization process.

## Key Insights

1. **Most "standard" protocols have dead mobile libraries** - Being an open standard doesn't guarantee maintained libraries

2. **Open Source ≠ Open Standard** - Socket.IO is free and open source but uses a proprietary protocol

3. **Library maintenance trumps protocol features** - Better to use a simpler protocol with active libraries than a perfect protocol with dead libraries

4. **Very few viable options** - The mobile ecosystem for open protocols is surprisingly poor
